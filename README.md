- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bippy
- 👀 I’m interested in Coding and Programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Java, I already know python, scratch, C, C++.

- 📫 How to reach me 
- 😄 Personality: I am funny and nice
- ⚡ Fun fact: x=3 in python works, but 3=x doesn't because you cannot assign "3"(the "variable(a number that crashes the system because it is a variable)" to a letter)
